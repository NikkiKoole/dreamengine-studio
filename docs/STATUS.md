# STATUS — what's shipped, what's open, what's decided-against

> **Single source of truth for project status.** The design docs

_Last updated: 2026-06-01 (session 13 — `fade()` made immediate-mode, fixing a 27-cart stuck-dim bug). Prior: session 12 — ragdoll physics demo cart._

## Shipped ✓

**Tooling & environment**
- Code editor (CodeMirror 6, C syntax, autocomplete + hover + Cmd-click-to-help),
  sprite editor, map editor — all in one PICO-8-style window.
- ▶ run (clang → native Raylib window), inline clang error markers.
- Cart format — `.cart.png` with source/sprites/map in zTXt chunks; save, load,
  drag-drop. Carts carry their own settings (screen/scale/cell/map).
- Tutorials gallery — 20 numbered tutorial carts + ~80 example game carts (~100 total).
- **`ragdoll.cart.png`** — Verlet physics sandbox. Up to 50 stick-figure ragdolls hop autonomously across the screen, bounce off each other and off rolling balls. Grab + throw with mouse (whole-body drag), right-click to spawn balls, C to spawn characters, R to reset. Key techniques: Störmer-Verlet integration, distance constraints (12 sticks/character, 8 iterations), position springs chained bottom-up (feet → knees → hip → chest → head), angular springs per bone with 90° guard (cross-product direction inverts past 90°), per-character standing/ragdoll timer that only recovers when feet are on the floor, hop impulse that immediately releases the foot pin so it isn't erased, broad-phase character collision (hip-to-hip > 40px early-out then 12×12 point pairs with velocity impulse). Debug session used the play.js harness + DE_TRACE watches to trace `rtimer`, `whop`, `hip_y`, `knee_y` and diagnose: rest lengths mismatched standing pose (hip-knee was 9, actual √73 ≈ 8.54 → knee pushed to floor); hop velocity erased by foot pre-pin each frame (fixed by setting `rtimer=0` inside `hop_tick` and re-reading `sk`). See `tools/carts/ragdoll.c`.
- Web build — "Build for web" (emscripten → `cart.html/js/wasm`, local server on 8765).
- 5-tab navbar (code · pixels · carts · docs · settings); in-app docs viewer renders
  this `docs/` set (with cross-links) in the Docs tab.
- Day/night theming, debug overlay (`watch`/`printh`/crash capture).

**API surface** — ~125 functions + ~90 constants in `runtime/studio.h`.
For the full grouped inventory see [`design/api-notes.md` → "What dreamengine has today"](design/api-notes.md).
Recently landed and worth calling out:
- Juice batch: `pal`/`pal_reset`, `fade`, `shake`, `print_scaled`, `text_width`.
- **Font system:** `font(FONT_NORMAL/FONT_SMALL/FONT_TINY)` state setter; two extra fonts baked (`font4x6.png` ~64 chars/320px, `font3x5.png` ~80 chars/320px); `print_shadow`, `print_outline`; all `print*` functions now return x-after-last-char for chaining and overflow detection. Demo: `fonts.cart.png`. See [`design/font-rendering.md`](design/font-rendering.md).
- Sprite transforms: `spr_rot`, `sspr_ex` (rotation/scale/flip around a pivot).
- Fill patterns: `fillp`/`fillp_reset` + `FILL_*` (PICO-8-style fillp).
- Shapes/helpers: `oval`/`ovalfill`, `bar`, `blink`, `fsqrt`.
- Pseudo-3D: `tritex` (affine texture-mapped triangle; used by `mode7`/`raycaster`/`cube3d`).
- 3D leaf-helpers: `V3` + `rot3`/`project3`/`zsort`/`quadfill` — the rotate→project→sort→fill
  pipeline the solid-3D carts re-derived by hand. `cube3d`/`solid3d`/`textured3d`/`flyover`
  refactored onto them. [decision 0009](decisions/0009-small-3d-leaf-helpers.md).
- **`fade()` is now immediate-mode** — the runtime zeroes it each frame, so a cart re-asserts
  `fade()` only on the frames it wants the screen dimmed and never calls `fade(0)` by hand. Fixed
  the same stuck-dim bug in **27 carts** at once (conditional overlay fade that never cleared on
  exit). `camera`/`pal`/`fillp` remain sticky setters. [decision 0010](decisions/0010-fade-is-immediate-mode.md).
- **Removed:** turtle graphics (`turtle_*`/`pen_*`) — one user, trivially a cart; see Cut
  below + [decision 0008](decisions/0008-cut-turtle-graphics-api.md).
- Input: full mouse (`mouse_x/y/down/pressed/released/wheel`), keyboard
  (`key`/`keyp`/`text_input`).
- Time/persistence: `dt`, `epoch`, `save_bytes`/`load_bytes`.

**Code-first sound** — 8-voice synth; `note`/`hit`/`chord`/`strum`/`tone`/`degree`,
`bpm`/`beat`, `every`/`euclid`/`chance`, `schedule`. (Banks `sfx`/`music` play built-in
demo data only — see "Open" below.)
- **Instrument synth** — `instr` is now an instrument slot (0–4 = the raw waves,
  unchanged; 5–15 cart-defined). Four expressive axes bundled per slot, all on the raw
  waveforms: `instrument()` (per-voice **ADSR**), `instrument_duty()` (pulse width),
  `instrument_lfo()` (**3 LFOs**/slot → vibrato/PWM/tremolo/wah), `instrument_filter()`
  (resonant SVF: low/high/band/notch). Demo carts: `instruments`, `lfo`, `filter`, and
  `dream synth` (a playable Moog-style patch panel + keyboard). See
  [`design/audio-notes.md`](design/audio-notes.md) §10.

## Open — prioritized

Ordered by leverage. Section refs point at the design doc that specs each item.

1. **Cart-pattern helpers** — `hud()` and `game_over_screen()` cut (see Decided-against).
   `explode()` / particle system is a **research topic** before any build: a no-param
   `explode()` risks making all carts look identical (same concern that killed `hud()`).
   Needs design work on color, shape, lifetime, and movement params first.
   See particle survey + open questions in [`design/api-notes.md`](design/api-notes.md) §C.
2. ~~**2D geometry helpers**~~ — **SHIPPED** as `ngon`/`ngonfill`, `star`/`starfill`, `poly`/`polyfill`, `thickline`, `rrect`/`rrectfill`, `vgradient`/`hgradient` (+ outline siblings `arcoutline`/`ringoutline`/`thicklineoutline` so every filled shape has a matching boundary-ring outline). Demo: `shapes.cart.png`. See [`design/geometry-helpers.md`](design/geometry-helpers.md).
   - *Parked thought (not a build item):* true smooth color interpolation (`lerp_color`/`rgb`) — splits the color model; needs its own ADR. Gradients are dithered.
3. **Events** — `broadcast(msg_id)` / `received(msg_id)`. Confirmed demand (independently
   surfaced by the brainstorm review). Touches main-loop drain semantics.
   [`design/api-notes.md`](design/api-notes.md) §11.
4. **Pause + debug** — `pause()`/`paused()`, `fps()`, `voices_active()`.
   [`design/api-notes.md`](design/api-notes.md) §16.
5. **Sound expansion** — _instrument bank (ADSR/duty/LFO/filter) now SHIPPED, see above._
   Still open: `slide()` (portamento); zero-setup **preset instruments** (`INSTR_PLUCK`/
   `PAD`/…); **held channels + per-param slew** (sustained, game-driven voices — the only
   way to get hold-to-sustain, which the synth cart currently fakes with a fixed gate);
   the **navkit rich-instrument port** (organ/Rhodes/piano as `INSTR_*` presets — drops
   into the timbre slot with no API change); and cart-side **SFX/pattern authoring**
   (banks are hardcoded today). [`design/audio-notes.md`](design/audio-notes.md) §5–8.
6. **Sprite flags** — `fget`/`fset` (per-sprite 8-bit flags; 256 bytes). Pairs with an
   8-checkbox row in the sprite editor. [`design/api-notes.md`](design/api-notes.md) 2026-05-30 review.
7. **Gamepad** — `gp_axis(slot, axis)`, `gp_present(slot)`, internal `btn()` augment.
   [`design/api-notes.md`](design/api-notes.md) §15.
8. **Strudel extras / Dilla groove timing** — `pitch`, `sometimes`/`often`/`rarely`,
   `arp`, `stutter`, `palindrome`, `off_beat`; `groove` + `groove_swing/jitter/push`,
   `tick`/`PPQ`. [`design/api-notes.md`](design/api-notes.md) §13–14.
9. **Per-game polish pass** — title/game-over screens, hi-scores, sound on every event,
   juice, difficulty curves, readable HUDs. (Reframed as a reference idea bank, not an
   active backlog — see [`POLISH_TODO.md`](POLISH_TODO.md).)
10. **Browser URL-sharing** — the web *build* ships; a one-click hosted **link** does not.
   [`guides/sharing.md`](guides/sharing.md).
11. **iPad runtime** — touch is wired in the runtime; needs a build path. [`VISION.md`](VISION.md).
12. **Sound tracker UI** — open question; depends on whether code-first sound proves
    sufficient. Prereq is cart-side SFX authoring (the instrument bank itself shipped).
    [`VISION.md`](VISION.md), [`design/audio-notes.md`](design/audio-notes.md) §5.6.

13. **Baked rotation atlas** *(exploratory — full design note, not yet started)* — an
    offscreen-canvas primitive (`make_canvas`/`target`/`blit`) plus pre-rotated sprite/shape
    "stamps" so bodies are fast translate-blits instead of per-frame rasterization (for
    crowds, rich shapes, low-end). Centerline/pivot model, `pal()` recolor for free color
    variety, parts capped at 16px (native slot size). The path to scaling the `bones`
    animator past realtime drawing. [`design/baked-rotation-atlas.md`](design/baked-rotation-atlas.md).
14. **Rasterization consistency** *(SHIPPED — every filled primitive on one coverage path)* —
    every filled primitive now shares one pixel-center coverage definition, so the outline is
    exactly the boundary of the fill (no rasterizer drift, dither = solid path):
    `rect`, `circ`/`oval`/`rrect` via `disc_inside`/`ellipse_inside`/`rrect_inside`;
    `tri`/`trifill`, `quadfill`, `ngon`/`star`/`poly` via even-odd `poly_inside` (concave-safe,
    winding-independent; `trifill_pat` deleted); `arc`/`arcfill`/`ring` via `sector_fill` (same
    pixel-centre disc); `thickline` via a capsule coverage (was `quadfill`+caps — the test found
    a 1px seam crack from a `w*0.5` body vs `w/2` cap mismatch). `trifill` is now CPU per-pixel —
    3D carts (`solid3d`/`cube3d`) smoke-tested OK; solid3d's face hairlines gone.
    Detector rewritten to a global invariant (outline == boundary of `fill ∪ outline`): catches
    a 1px offset at any angle, never false-flags sharp tips; verified to have teeth (GPU tris →
    282). Open strokes verified by a 4th-page equivalence self-test (ring==annulus, sector-tiling
    ==disc, thickline solid). Verified: all 11 marker states (3 pages × 4) + 3 equivalence checks
    = 0.
    **Still open (verification, not design):** perf of CPU `trifill` vs old GPU (unmeasured);
    web GL ES confirmation (`pget` disabled on web); an ADR for the GPU→CPU `tri`/`trifill` +
    `thickline` behaviour change.
    **Regression test:** `tools/carts/raster_test.c` + `tools/raster_test.script` —
    drag `editor/public/carts/raster_test.cart.png` into the editor (Z outline, X dither,
    C cycle 4 pages, SPACE analyse / run equiv), or run headless:
    `node tools/play.js raster_test script tools/raster_test.script --headless --trace build/raster_trace.jsonl --frames 60`
    then check every `fs=2` frame reports `mismatches:"0"` and the `eq` line shows `total=0`.
    [`design/rasterization-consistency.md`](design/rasterization-consistency.md).
15. ~~**Tiny fonts**~~ — **SHIPPED** as `font(FONT_SMALL/FONT_TINY)`. See Shipped above.

> `tritex` (affine textured triangle) shipped in session 8 — it was Open here; now in the API.

**Smaller open items (no design doc yet):** looping ambience (`drone`)/`volume`/mute. Noted
in [`POLISH_TODO.md`](POLISH_TODO.md).

## Decided-against / deferred ✗

These were considered and **cut** — kept here so the decision isn't relitigated.
Rationale lives in [`design/api-notes.md`](design/api-notes.md)'s "What to defer or skip" and the 2026-05-30 review.

- **Process / coroutine model (DIV-style)** — the would-be "Level-2" learning model.
  Every shipped cart works cleanly with plain typed static pools, so it's weeks
  of coroutine/transformer machinery for a model we don't need. [`VISION.md`](VISION.md).
- **Engine-owned entity system** (God-struct / `SELF` / `val[16]` / ECS) — per-game
  typed pools with *named* fields beat all of them for a learn-C console.
- **MMF movement/qualifier engines** (`move_platform`, `move_8dir`) — removes the lesson.
- **`move_and_collide`** (resolved tile push-out) — low demand; only `platform.c` does
  the full pattern, and `zelda`/`gta` test against their own data, not `mget`.
- **DS structures** (lists/maps/grids), **memory arenas**, **PS1 z-sort/ordering table**,
  **tools-as-carts / VFS / fantasy-OS / peek-poke**, a **3D *engine*** (scene graph / mat4
  stack / z-buffer / per-pixel depth) — out of scope. *(The small 3D leaf-helpers
  `rot3`/`project3`/`zsort`/`quadfill` + `V3` ARE shipped — see below and [decision 0009].)*
- **Particle systems** and **pathfinding** — ship as *library carts* (seeds: `astar.c`,
  `boids.c`), not engine surface.
- **Pixel-perfect sprite collision** — eventually maybe; AABB covers 95% first.
- **Turtle graphics API** (`turtle_*`/`pen_*`) — shipped, then **removed 2026-06-01**: only
  `16-spirograph.c` used it, and a turtle is just `dx`/`dy` + `line()`, so it lives in the
  cart now. [decision 0008](decisions/0008-cut-turtle-graphics-api.md).
