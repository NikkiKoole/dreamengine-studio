# The distortion lab — a "destruction unit" playground

Status: **EXPLORING / IDEA (2026-07-11).** A scratchpad for a new cart that goes *beyond* the four
built-in drive modes into modern "super distortion plugin" territory (stacking, tone-stacking,
combos). Nothing built yet. The plan is **start simple, grow** — the increment ladder below is the
proposed order, not a spec. Born from the acidrack chat where the 303 got a drive-mode selector and
the maker wanted to experiment further.

## Why — and what we already have

The engine already carries a real distortion palette, so this is **not greenfield**:

- **`instrument_drive(slot, amount)` + `instrument_drive_mode(slot, DRIVE_*)`** — four waveshapers,
  post-filter, true-bypass at 0, loudness-normalized (character not volume):
  - `DRIVE_SOFT` — tanh soft-clip, warm tube overdrive (**the default** — what everything used before
    modes existed, and still the 303's default)
  - `DRIVE_HARD` — hard clip, buzzy square-edged digital fuzz
  - `DRIVE_FOLD` — sine wavefolder, metallic/glassy/ring-mod-ish (the "West Coast" texture)
  - `DRIVE_ASYM` — asymmetric tube, fat **even** harmonics (+ a little DC, cleaned by the DC blocker)
- **`drive_insert(amount, mode, mix)` + `drive_insert_inst(instance, …)`** — the same waveshapers as a
  **mix-bus insert**, with a *second instance* → you can **cascade** (overdrive INTO an amp) in one
  chain via `fx_order(0, {FX_DRIVE, FX_INST(FX_DRIVE,1)})`.
- **`eq(lo, mid, hi)`** (±12 dB) — the **tone stack**. The effects-bus doc notes EQ *before AND after*
  a clipper is buffer-free and audibly different (input-shape vs output-shape). This is the
  Decapitator/guitar-amp move that turns fizz into character.
- **`crush()` / `tape()`** — bitcrush (digital decimation grit) and tape (wow/flutter/soft-sat) to
  layer on for total destruction.

### What already exists in cart-land (checked 2026-07-11 — do NOT duplicate)

- **`drivemodes`** (tech-demo) — the clean **reference**: the 4 modes side-by-side on a growling
  bass, a representative waveshape drawn under each panel, LEFT/RIGHT to pick, UP/DOWN for amount.
  Keep it as the tidy "here are the 4 flavours" showcase. The lab is the *playground beyond* it.
- **`bitcrush`** — the crush showcase.
- **`acidrack`** — as of 2026-07-11 each 303's `[fx]` view has a SOFT/HARD/FOLD/ASYM selector
  (`instrument_drive_mode`). The lab's payoff loop is to pull a richer recipe back here (below).

So the lab's job is the ground **none of those cover**: stacking, tone-stacking, and combos.

## The growth ladder (start simple → grow)

Each rung is playable/committable on its own; stop wherever it stops being fun.

- **Rung 0 — one stage, interactive.** A through-voice + ONE drive stage: mode button (SOFT/HARD/
  FOLD/ASYM) + amount knob + a live **transfer-curve** drawing (input→output shape) so you *see* the
  fold/clip/asym. Essentially `drivemodes` but interactive and the seed of the chain.
- **Rung 1 — the tone stack.** Add EQ *before* and *after* the clipper (`eq()` pre + post). This is
  the single biggest character upgrade — pre-EQ picks what gets distorted, post-EQ tames the fizz.
- **Rung 2 — cascade.** A SECOND drive stage (`drive_insert_inst`) so you can stack waveshapers
  (fold → hard, soft → asym). "Overdrive into the amp."
- **Rung 3 — destruction combos.** Fold `crush` + `tape` into the chain → grit + lo-fi + saturation
  stacked. The "go nuts" rung.
- **Rung 4 — reorderable chain.** Make the stages a `pedalboard`-style drag-to-reorder chain so
  order-dependence is audible (drive→eq→crush vs crush→eq→drive). `fx_order` already models this.
- **Rung 5 — live spectrum.** A spectrum/FFT strip alongside the transfer curve, to *watch* the
  harmonics bloom. (Nice-to-have; the transfer curve alone teaches most of it.)

## Engine gaps (NOT cart work — note as engine todos if we want them)

The genuinely-modern tricks the engine can't do yet — flag, don't fake:

- **Multiband distortion** (FabFilter Saturn's signature) — split into bands, distort each
  differently. Needs a band-splitter in `sound.h`.
- **Drawable / arbitrary transfer curves** — a waveshaper fed a user-drawn lookup table. Would be a
  new `DRIVE_*` kind + a curve buffer.
- **Rectification / octave-up fuzz** — half/full-wave rectify (ASYM is the closest built-in). Cheap
  new mode if wanted.

## Open questions (undecided — decide when we build, not now)

- **Core interaction:** reorderable pedal chain (richest) · fixed 3-stage rig (pre-EQ→drive→post-EQ)
  · dual-stage A/B (narrowest, closest to `drivemodes`+). Leaning: start at a fixed rig or dual-stage,
  grow toward the reorderable chain.
- **Through-voice:** a playable `keybed.h` (play what you distort) · an auto-riff drone (hands-free,
  like `drivemodes`) · both (auto by default, grab a keybed on a key). Leaning: auto-riff first
  (fastest), add keybed later.

## The payoff loop

The lab isn't just a toy: once a stacked recipe sounds great (say **fold → post-EQ → asym**, or a
crush-flavoured "Muffler"), pull it back into a real voice — a two-stage **"Muffler"-style** drive
for the 303 (the acidrack DEEP-page notes already wanted a Devil-Fish-style post-VCA Muffler). Cart
→ recipe → instrument.
