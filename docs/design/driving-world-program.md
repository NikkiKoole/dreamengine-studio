# The Driving World — program map

STATUS: LIVING MAP (2026-06-30). The umbrella over the whole "build a vehicle, drive a procedural world" research — sloop + the road/world/city/render carts as **one program, not a pile of carts.** Sits ABOVE [`road-program-state.md`](road-program-state.md) (which is only the road-geometry tier) and pulls the other layers — movement, the world spine, rendering, real-world data, city content — into one read. Use it to see how far each layer is and **what to finish first.** Update the status table + the "finish first" call when a layer moves.

> Companion to [`big-game-backlog.md`](big-game-backlog.md) (what's left *per cart* + the cross-cutting seams) and [`showreel-teaser.md`](showreel-teaser.md) (the trailer as a forcing function). This doc is the **horizontal map**: the layers, where they converge, and the recommended order. The field note [`field-notes/004-roads-as-convergence-layer.md`](../field-notes/004-roads-as-convergence-layer.md) is the discovery this formalizes.

## The thing being built

A **lo-fi GTA1-but-better** ([`showreel-teaser.md`](showreel-teaser.md), [`second-north-star.md`](second-north-star.md)): an *infinite, deterministic, procedural world you drive around*, assembled from many small spec-locked sandbox carts rather than one monolith. The honest core (per the north star): **author the rules, let the system judge you — nothing faked.** sloop's rig isn't a sprite with stats, it's a grid of parts whose handling is computed; the world isn't a backdrop, it's collidable geometry streamed from a seed.

The discovery in field note 004: **roads became the convergence layer** — the substrate where procedural generation, computational geometry, OSM import, rendering, and (future) traffic all meet. The deeper abstraction is probably **networks** (roads first; rivers/rails/pedestrians/utilities later). This program map is what that convergence looks like as a build plan.

## The stack — every cart + doc, by layer

Seven layers, bottom (what you drive *on*) to top (what you drive *as* / *see it through*). Status: ✅ done · ◑ partial · ○ sketch/seed · ⏸ parked.

### 1. Movement — the rig and the feel
The player and how driving feels. The most mature consumer layer.

| Cart | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **`sloop`** | ◑ deep (rungs 1–2.7 + collidable world) | **The flagship.** Build-a-vehicle-from-parts → drive a chunk-streamed, collidable city. Rigid-body handling computed from the part grid; drift, gears, per-wheel springs; cones/houses/parked-cars resolved by one impulse. *Drives its OWN internal world today — not yet the shared spine (see §Frontier).* Docs: [`sloop.md`](sloop.md), [`sloop-production.md`](sloop-production.md) (the money/process axis, cart `thecut`), [`sloop-handwork.md`](sloop-handwork.md) (the embodied axis, cart `handwork`). |
| **`drivemodes`** | ✅ bench | Driving-feel testbed (steering/grip models). |
| **`trackgen`** | ✅ + traffic | Kart racer; also the **host for `traffic-ai`** (NPC driving prototyped as a TRAFFIC mode). |
| **`outrun`** | ✅ (lineage) | Classic pseudo-3D arcade road — the ancestor of the render layer. |

### 2. The world spine — infinite deterministic generation
The substrate sloop is *meant* to drive. **This is the least-settled layer.** The honest read (2026-06-30): neither `roadnet` nor `roadnet2` is presumed to be the final spine — both have sat untouched for a while, and the answer may be one of them, a merge, or a fresh third path. **Don't discard either yet** — go cold on both before deciding (see §Decisions / P0).

| Cart | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **`roadnet`** | ◑ rungs 1–3 + L2 (blocks/lots) | The spline arterial network over a heightmap — broke procgen-places' "arced roads" wall. Ranked hub/town hierarchy, terrain-aware bends/bridges, an L2 street level in the magnifier. Exposes the **`road_at()` query seam** sloop is meant to consume. Docs: [`roadnet.md`](roadnet.md), [`roadnet-handoff.md`](roadnet-handoff.md) (★ start here), [`roadnet-streetlevel.md`](roadnet-streetlevel.md). |
| **`roadnet2`** | ◑ foundation only | The **vector-native rewrite** — fixes v1's one mistake (two diverging street representations) by going one-graph/one-`road_at`. *This is the intended architecture; only the L0 spline core is ported so far.* Docs: [`roadnet2-plan.md`](roadnet2-plan.md), [`roadnet2-handoff.md`](roadnet2-handoff.md). |
| **`procplaces`** | ✅ v2 (tile-based) | The proven L2 reference generator (roads & cities on a tile grid); `road_at()` = collision==render seam. Frozen reference now. Doc: [`procgen-places.md`](procgen-places.md). |
| **`worldgen`, `gridcity`** | ✅ benches | Supporting world-gen testbeds (heightmap / grid-city scaffolds). |

### 3. Road geometry — the spec-locked sandboxes
**This layer is essentially done.** Full detail in [`road-program-state.md`](road-program-state.md) — don't duplicate; the summary:

| Cart | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **`roadlab`** | ✅ done + spec-locked (25) | Grade-separated **interchanges** — the whole roads.org.uk catalogue from `(legs, type)` at any skew. Seam: `make_junction()`. |
| **`streetlab`** | ✅ junction + network done + spec-locked (104) | **At-grade junctions** (curb returns, turn lanes, roundabouts, free-rights, typed cross-sections) + the **local-street network** (grid/organic/radial/cul-de-sac/superblock, SNDi metrics). Seam: `gen_network()`. |

Ratified by [ADR-0021](../decisions/0021-road-geometry-in-2d-sandbox-render-is-an-adapter.md): **geometry is developed in 2D top-down; the pseudo-3D view is a downstream adapter.**

### 4. City content — the fill language
What populates the land between and inside buildings. **Shipped; multi-storey is the open edge.**

| Cart | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **`cityplan`** | ✅ stages A–D | **The forward cart** — the lotfill+interiors merge: a world you lift the roof off by zooming (city of roofs → BSP floor-plans → furniture). Multi-storey tenements = backlog. Doc: [`cityplan.md`](cityplan.md). |
| **`lotfill`** | ✅ (reference) | The fill language *between* buildings (terrain/forest/farm/blocks/lots). Doc: [`streetlevel-content.md`](streetlevel-content.md). |
| **`interiors`** | ✅ (reference) | The fill language *inside* one footprint (R/C/I floor plans). Doc: [`interiors-brief.md`](interiors-brief.md). |
| **`floorplan`** | ✅ | Floor-plan testbed. |

### 5. Rendering — the view onto the world
How the world is *shown*. ADR-0021's "adapter" layer.

| Cart | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **`cityview`** | ✅ bench | The **pseudo-3D city look** — GTA1-meets-Zelda parallel-oblique projection (height pushes pixels up; ground stays plan). Seeded boxes. Doc: [`pseudo-3d-city.md`](pseudo-3d-city.md). |
| **`citydrive`** | ✅ (newest, 2026-06-30) | cityview's **data-driven successor** — same projection/driving, but extrudes REAL OSM footprints (roadview's `.rvb`), drapes over real terrain (DEM), pitched-perspective camera. *Drive a real city in pseudo-3D.* |
| **field-based road rendering** | ✅ opt-in (`DE_FIELD_ROADS`) | One lateral distance field, every feature a threshold — the clean replacement for per-arm casing blits. **Cutover deferred on purpose** until the software canvas makes per-pixel fills cheap. Doc: [`field-based-road-rendering.md`](field-based-road-rendering.md). |

### 6. Real-world data — the world isn't only generated
The transition field note 004 called significant: consuming OSM instead of generating everything.

| Cart | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **`roadview`** | ✅ shipped | Loads real OSM road geometry at RUNTIME (`.rvb` packed binary; Rotterdam 28 MB in ~0.66 s) — swap the file, see a different city. Pipeline: `data-tools/roadview/osm-roads.js`. Doc: [`external-data-carts.md`](external-data-carts.md). |
| **`citydrive`** | (see §5) | The pseudo-3D consumer of the same `.rvb` data. |

### 7. Agents — life on the network (the frontier)
| Cart | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **`traffic-ai`** (in `trackgen`) | ◑ BUILDING | NPC driving — lane-keeping, IDM car-following, overtaking, traffic lights, phantom jams, K-turns. *Only the line they follow changes to wire into the real world* (`cl[]` → `road_at()`). Doc: [`traffic-ai.md`](traffic-ai.md). |
| pedestrians / crowds | ○ seed | `menigte.md` — 10k closed-form NPCs; the on-foot population. |

## Where the layers converge — the seams

The grammar (layer 3) and benches (4, 5, 6) are largely built **in isolation**. The program's real frontier is **composition** — three named seams, none of which any single cart owns yet:

1. **`road_at()` → sloop** *(layer 2 → layer 1)* — the moment the rig drives the *shared* world instead of its own internal generator. The backlog calls this the core: *"roadnet2's street tiers + `road_at`→sloop is its core. Everything waits on this."* Marked `// SEAM (Phase 2)` in code.
2. **The world composer** *(layer 3 → layer 2)* — the two-tier major→minor generator that emits a *different* `(pattern, region)` per place (streetlab's `gen_network`) and `(legs, type)` per crossing (roadlab's `make_junction`), stitched at boundaries. Today one pattern fills the whole view. This is Phase 2 of [`road-program-state.md`](road-program-state.md).
3. **The render adapter over real geometry** *(layer 5 over 2/3/6)* — `citydrive` already proves the pseudo-3D view works over real OSM data; the open question is whether sloop's *player* view becomes this adapter over the *generated* world.

## The convergence — real-in / synth-in / one render

We've been building the world from **two ends**, and they're not rivals — they're the two halves of one missing middle. The grammar end (`roadlab` + `streetlab`) and the data end (`roadview` + `citydrive`) each have exactly what the other lacks:

| | **roadlab + streetlab** (grammar end) | **roadview + citydrive** (data end) |
|---|---|---|
| Source | a seed + parameters | real OSM, loaded at runtime |
| **Knows** | *semantics* — "this is a T-junction, curb-return R, a turn bay, a give-way line, a 2+bike+parking section" | *almost nothing* — "a polyline tagged `residential`" |
| **Has** | toy scale (≈54 nodes), idealized, infinite/deterministic | real scale (Rotterdam ≈420k ways), messy, plausible, immediate |
| Geometry | derived from rules, **correct**, drivable (lanes, turns) | flat ribbons that overlap at junctions — **no junction model, no lanes** |
| Render | 2D top-down ([ADR-0021](../decisions/0021-road-geometry-in-2d-sandbox-render-is-an-adapter.md)); pseudo-3D is an adapter | `citydrive` **is** that adapter, proven over arbitrary polygons + DEM |

Bluntly: **`streetlab` understands roads but has no real ones; `roadview` has real roads but understands nothing about them.** Semantics without scale, vs scale without semantics. Neither is a world alone — and that's *why* the spine (roadnet/roadnet2) felt stuck: it's the hard middle that joins them. The grounding is already there — the `.rvb` classifies every way into a real road ladder (highway/arterial/secondary/tertiary/road/service/cycleway/footway + bridge/tunnel/ref), and `streetlab`'s `gen_network()` produces the *same* node/edge graph shape OSM is.

### The four bridges (ranked by leverage)

1. **OSM intersections → `streetlab`'s junction renderer** *(the killer one).* At each real OSM node, read the incident ways' bearings + classes → that's `(legs)` and roughly `(type)`, exactly streetlab's leg-model input. Now a real city renders with real **curb returns, turn lanes, crosswalks, roundabouts** instead of overlapping ribbons. This is the **"network→junction zoom"** already named as Phase-3 step 9 in [`road-program-state.md`](road-program-state.md) — *except the network comes from reality, not a synthetic pattern.*

   **OSM pre-labels the roadlab↔streetlab split for you.** roadlab and streetlab aren't merged — they're two specialists under one per-crossing dispatcher (grade-separated vs at-grade; class only *predicts* which). OSM hands you that dispatch decision free: three independent signals say "grade-separated (→ `roadlab`'s `make_junction`)" vs "at-grade (→ streetlab)":
   - **The ramps are tagged.** `highway=*_link` (motorway_link / trunk_link / …) *are* the on/off-ramps and slip roads → those `_link` ways are roadlab's ramp legs.
   - **Grade separation is tagged.** `bridge` / `tunnel` / `layer=±N` mark which segment rides over/under.
   - **Topology is the cleanest tell.** A real intersection is a **shared graph node**; a flyover is two ways that **cross in 2D but share no node** (different `layer`). Crossing-with-a-node → at-grade; crossing-without-a-node → grade-separated. No tags needed.

   **⚠ Step 0 (do this first): the current `.rvb` throws all three away.** `data-tools/roadview/osm-roads.js` collapses `motorway_link` into plain `highway` (`/^(motorway|trunk)(_link)?$/ → 'highway'`) and keeps **no** `bridge`/`tunnel`/`layer`. The raw OSM has it; our importer flattens it. So the spike begins by teaching `osm-roads.js` to *preserve* the `_link` class + `bridge`/`tunnel`/`layer` + the shared-node-vs-crossing topology — then the cart routes each crossing mechanically, because the data already knows the answer. **Two known limits:** dual carriageways arrive as two parallel one-way ways (a "single" motorway = two lines to reconcile), and `_link` ways give ramp *centerlines* but not the interchange *type* (diamond/cloverleaf/stack) — you infer that from how the links wire the carriageways together, which is exactly roadlab's `(legs, type)` classification run backwards.
2. **Real cities calibrate the synthetic generator.** `streetlab`'s SNDi metrics (degree, circuity, sinuosity, node-mix) measure any network; `roadview` is now a free, endless corpus of *real* neighbourhoods. Classify a district → "superblock, circuity 1.6" → the generator emits more like it. Closes field-note-004's "learned generative models" question **without ML** — just metric-matching against reality.
3. **The grammar synthesizes the lanes OSM lacks.** OSM has ~no lane/curb detail; `streetlab`'s typed cross-section (HW = sum of lanes) *infers* a plausible section from the OSM class (`secondary` → 2 lanes + maybe bike). The real city gets lanes you can **drive in, follow with `traffic-ai`, cross on foot** — the thing real data can't give that the grammar can.
4. **One render adapter, two geometry sources.** `citydrive` already projects pseudo-3D over arbitrary polygons + terrain; streetlab/roadlab geometry is 2D-top-down *with pseudo-3D as the adapter* — so the **same** projection renders real OSM *and* synthetic junctions. `cityview` (boxes) and `citydrive` (real) are just two feeds into it.

**The deep version of all four:** a **common intermediate model — a typed centerline network + a junction/cross-section grammar — that both ends emit and one renderer consumes.** A synthetic junction and a real OSM polyline are both "centerline + width + class." [`field-based-road-rendering.md`](field-based-road-rendering.md) already points here (every feature is a threshold on a lateral distance field; it doesn't care whether the centerline came from a seed or from Breda).

### Why this reframes the spine

The thing the world spine should *be* is this common model — **a centerline-network + junction-grammar world, seedable from OSM *or* procedurally.** Both ingest halves exist (`roadview` = real-in, `streetlab` = synth-in) and the render half exists (`citydrive`). roadnet/roadnet2 were attempts at the *generation* half that predate the grammar and the renderer, so they re-invented pieces that now live better elsewhere — which is exactly why "neither makes it as-is." See the reframed **P0** below.

## ★ Finish the right stuff first

The honest read: **the sandboxes are done; the payoff now is integration, not more sandbox polish.** roadlab, streetlab, cityplan, cityview, roadview are all shipped or spec-locked. The risk is endlessly adding junction primitives and metrics (diminishing returns — the grammar is complete) while the three seams above stay open. Recommended order:

**P0 — Define the spine as the common model, not as a salvage of roadnet/roadnet2.** *Blocks layer 2 and seam 1, and it's the genuinely open question.* The reframe (see §Convergence): the spine we want is **a typed centerline-network + junction-grammar world, seedable from OSM *or* procedurally** — and we've already built both ingest halves (`roadview` real-in, `streetlab` synth-in) and the render half (`citydrive`). So P0 is *not* "which old cart survives." It's:
- **(a)** Settle the common model — the centerline + class + junction-node representation that `streetlab`'s `gen_network` output, an OSM `.rvb`, and `citydrive`'s renderer all agree on (bridge #4's intermediate form).
- **(b)** Cold re-read roadnet/roadnet2 (`node tools/orient.js roadnet` / `roadnet2`, then drive them) with one question: *what generation-over-terrain do they uniquely have that nothing else covers?* — the spline-highway-over-heightmap core, the LOD streaming, the terrain-aware bends. **Graft those onto the model; don't ask either cart to be the whole spine.** Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater — but don't crown it either.

The outcome either way: **one spine, one `road_at()`,** fed from a seed or from reality.

**P1 — Wire `road_at()` into sloop (seam 1).** *The single highest-leverage move in the whole program* — it's what makes "a procedural world you drive" literally true, and it's the convergence field note 004 named. sloop already streams a collidable world; swap its internal generator for the chosen spine's `road_at()`. The backlog lists this as "rung 4" and "the only real remaining work."

**P2 — Land NPC traffic on the real world (seam 1, layer 7).** traffic-ai's behaviour is built in trackgen; only the followed line changes (`cl[]` → `road_at()`). Once P1 lands, this is mostly a provider swap and makes the world feel *alive*, not empty.

**P3 — The world composer (seam 2 / Phase 2).** Two-tier major→minor generator stitching streetlab patterns per region. **Only after P0–P1** — composing before there's a spine + consumer is premature.

**Parallel track (not blocking) — the render decision (seam 3).** citydrive proves pseudo-3D over real data; decide whether the player view adopts the cityview adapter over generated geometry. Independent of P0–P3; can proceed whenever.

**Explicitly defer (don't let these masquerade as progress):**
- More streetlab primitives — staggered junctions, the modal active-travel layer, dendricity metric. The grammar is done; these are sandbox polish. ([`road-program-state.md`](road-program-state.md) tracks them.)
- The field-based road cutover — correctly blocked on `software-canvas.md` (already in flight).
- cityplan multi-storey tenements — nice, but not on the critical path to a drivable world.

## Decisions to make (open forks)

1. **The world spine — what *is* it?** The P0 blocker, reframed (see §Convergence): the spine is most likely **the common centerline-network + junction-grammar model, seedable from OSM or procedurally** — not roadnet or roadnet2 as a whole. Open: settle that intermediate model (a), and decide which unique generation-over-terrain pieces of roadnet/roadnet2 graft onto it (b). Neither cart is crowned or discarded; both are mined for the part nothing else covers.
2. **Is the abstraction "roads" or "networks"?** Field note 004's open question. If networks, the spine's `road_at()` generalizes to rivers/rails/paths — worth knowing *before* P0 locks the data model.
3. **Player view: top-down (sloop today) or pseudo-3D (citydrive's adapter)?** Affects whether seam 3 is on the main path or a side quest.
