# Cart specs — Batch 3

Third wave — fills the empty *genres* the catalog was missing (board games, match-3 /
falling-block, card games, word games, classic fixed shooters, dig-'em, single-screen
arcade) plus a few high-value one-offs. Built the same orchestrated way as batch 2 (see
"Building many in parallel" in [`cart-specs-index.md`](cart-specs-index.md)); pairs under the brief in
[`cart-authoring-prompt.md`](cart-authoring-prompt.md). Batches 1 & 2 stay intact as
their own historic records.
